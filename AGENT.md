# Agent Log

## Context
Initial repository had no AGENT log. `PATCHLOG.md` captured early development on the CLI and branch graph. Subsequent sessions added persistence, a REPL, networking, AI hooks and plugin support.

## Decisions
- Persist branches in `src/branch_manager.c` with `~/.aos/branches.json`.
- Maintain a `BranchGraph` adjacency matrix for hierarchy operations.
- Host REPL implemented in `src/main.c`.
- AI commands call `scripts/ai_backend.py` via `ai_syscall.c`.
