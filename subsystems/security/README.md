# Security Subsystem

This subsystem will provide authentication, authorization and encryption helpers.

Roadmap:

- User credential management.
- Policy enforcement hooks.
- Optional TLS support for network services.

**Baton pass**: Security primitives are placeholders. Next agent should hook
the policy engine into the network layer and outline credential storage
mechanisms in `AGENT.md`.
