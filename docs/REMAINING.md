# Remaining Work

Open tasks still pending implementation:

- Expand audit log coverage across all subsystems.
- Improve documentation for newly added subsystems and update diagrams regularly.

Progress on credential fallback, provider contract checks and orchestrator error
mapping has landed. Remaining items are tracked in `AGENT.md`.
