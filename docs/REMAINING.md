# Remaining Work

The following areas are not yet fully implemented and require future attention:

- Expand audit log coverage across all subsystems.
- Investigate the missing `branch` Makefile target referenced by `verify_all.sh`.
- Improve documentation for newly added subsystems and update diagrams regularly.

These tasks are tracked in `AGENT.md` and should be addressed in subsequent versions.
