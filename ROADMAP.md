# AOS Roadmap

## Short-term
- Improve test coverage across subsystems.

- Stabilise logging and error handling APIs.

## Long-term
- Full networking stack with TLS.
- Graphical desktop enhancements.
- Package manager and plugin marketplace.

Major milestones are tracked by version tags in git.

## Current Sprint Goals

- Expand ext2 filesystem backend and add persistence tests.
- Implement basic WASM runtime with capability checks.
- Integrate checkpoint delta handling in branch management.

## Baton Pass
- Keep this roadmap updated as milestones are reached.
