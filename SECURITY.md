# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability in AOS, please report it privately.
Email **security@example.com** and CC the maintainers listed in
`docs/dev/AGENT.md`. Do not open public issues for security reports.

We will acknowledge receipt within two business days and aim to provide
a fix or mitigation within 30 days. After a fix is available we will
publish a security advisory and credit you for the disclosure if desired.
