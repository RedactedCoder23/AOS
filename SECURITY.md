# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability in AOS, please report it privately by
emailing the maintainers listed in `AGENT.md`. Do not open public
issues for security reports.

We will acknowledge receipt within two business days and work with you
to assess the impact. Once a fix is ready we will publish a security
advisory and credit you for the disclosure if desired.
